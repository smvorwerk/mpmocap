Watch the video below to see how the 52 blendshape values are used as a music synthesizer:

In this example, Pure Data is used to receive OSC data, which then controls various sine waves to play or shift their pitch.

Find the Pure Data code in the [example folder of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/need4steve/mpmocap/blob/main/examples/OSC/face-oscillator.pd).
