MPMoCap includes an app that enables you to receive data from the MPMoCap website.
Review the [documentation](https://mocap.robotrebellion.xyz/docs) to learn how to use the website.

## Download the App
Download and install the app for your platform [here](https://mocap.robotrebellion.xyz/downloads).

MPMoCap is a free open-source project without funding.
**Due to the lack of a paid yearly developer license, the app will not be signed, and your OS will display a warning.**
You can still run the app by following the instructions below.

## Windows
After downloading the app, your browser may display a warning. Simply keep the file.
